# About Game Cloud

For the e-commerce platform Game Cloud, I assumed the responsibility of a full stack developer, implementing the CRUD functionalities of MongoDB. This gaming platform accommodates customers by providing an extensive selection of games to peruse. Three principal categories are displayed on the homepage: Carousel, Popular, and New Games. Through the use of game names or image clicks, users are able to engage with the games through an engrossing hover effect. The carousel is equipped with navigation controls on both ends, facilitating users in effortlessly perusing the assortment. An exhaustive catalogue of all the activities available on the website can be found on the More page. Each column serves as an interactive component featuring a name and an image, which guides users to the Individual Page, which contains comprehensive information about the game. Embrace the opportunity to select your preferred games and engage in a pleasurable gaming experience.

## How To Install

To get started, clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/EmilioCarreiraOWI/DV200_Group1_Term4
```

Navigate to the 'client' folder to install all the dependencies
```
npm i
```

Navigate to the 'server' folder to install all the dependencies
```
npm i
```

Run the build on your local host
```
npm start
```

Run the MongoDB server
```
npm run dev
```

## The Idea

The idea was to create a centralised hub where students can post questions or just share anything that they find interesting or inspirations and have other students engage with the post to either help them or just say thank you.

## Development Process

### Highlights
* Highlights of the website is the simplistic UI and the functionality that gives the user a pleasant user experience.
* The website is easy to understand and navigate.
* The website makes use of [Quill.js](https://quilljs.com) rich text editor for seamless post creation and styling.

### Challenges
* Future proofing the website in a functional yet optimised way that makes use of components and templates where possible to keep the website running smooth and simplify updates in the future
* Building the website in such a way that everything is automated, from automatically creating user profiles and displaying only their own posts to creating new communities and automatically generating a community page and adding it to the navbar.

## Future Implementations

* Allow Users to view other user Profiles
* Add admin and moderator functionality to each community
* Add super admin functionality that allows Open Window staff to post announcements and event details to the home page
* Allow any student to create their own communities for something like a horror club, DnD club etc.
