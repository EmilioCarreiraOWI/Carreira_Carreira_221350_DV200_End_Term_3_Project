# About Game Cloud

For the e-commerce platform Game Cloud, I assumed the responsibility of a full stack developer, implementing the CRUD functionalities of MongoDB. This gaming platform accommodates customers by providing an extensive selection of games to peruse. Three principal categories are displayed on the homepage: Carousel, Popular, and New Games. Through the use of game names or image clicks, users are able to engage with the games through an engrossing hover effect. The carousel is equipped with navigation controls on both ends, facilitating users in effortlessly perusing the assortment. An exhaustive catalogue of all the activities available on the website can be found on the More page. Each column serves as an interactive component featuring a name and an image, which guides users to the Individual Page, which contains comprehensive information about the game. Embrace the opportunity to select your preferred games and engage in a pleasurable gaming experience.

## How To Install

To get started, clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/EmilioCarreiraOWI/Carreira_Carreira_221350_DV200_End_Term_3_Project.git
```

Navigate to the 'client' folder to install all the dependencies
```
npm i
```

Navigate to the 'server' folder to install all the dependencies
```
npm i
```

Run the build on your local host
```
npm start
```

Run the MongoDB server
```
npm run dev
```

## The Idea

The project uses MongoDB and full-stack development to provide a dynamic platform. On Game Cloud's homepage, you may find interactive game displays, carousel navigation, and a comprehensive game catalogue under sections including Carousel, Popular, and New Games. The individual page should include an easy-to-use interface, a wide selection of games, and comprehensive details about each game.

## Development Process

### Challenges
* transferring the game card to the dedicated page and purchasing the game from there page. in order for it to be stored in the database
* One of the features worked as intended and was able to update the games on the website. The creator is able to add and remove games from the website, but not update

## Future Implementations

* Update Functionality will be added
* lybrary page will be added, so save the game the users has bought
